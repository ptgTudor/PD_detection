# 1. The web application

The aim of this project is to provide individuals that might present symptoms of the disease with a simple tool that they can use for an instant diagnosis. This was driven by the long diagnosis times associated with the disease, as well as the difficulty that might be present in some cases in accessing proper specialized healthcare, due to a variety of reasons.

The requirements to access this would only consist of Internet connection and a microphone. Subjects can submit samples for various tests after listening to examples based on the test they chose and these samples will be sent to a server where a stored model will try to predict whether the submission comes from someone with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease or from someone without it. The model will be the subject of a machine learning, more precisely deep learning application created with the help of the Python programming language, with the MATLAB programming language also contributing to development.
